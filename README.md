# Linked List Project

This is my version of implementing the data structure [linked lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) in ruby.

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/recursion).

## Installation

Open your Terminal/Command Line. Navigate to the directory where your version will live. Type in the following:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/JonathanYiv/linked_list.git
$ cd linked_list
$ ruby linkedlist.rb
```

## Pre-Project Thoughts

Odin has been having me go through various types of data structures and algorithms. 
I find them really fascinating and definitely have a gap of knowledge regarding them.
Implementing Linked Lists will be beneficial for me to understand how a data structure is built.

## Post-Project Thoughts

This project is currently incomplete.
